What is Hack Oregon?
--------------------

`Hack Oregon`_ is a rapid prototyping lab taking a creative approach to
data projects that bring insight to complex issues in the public
interest. Weâ€™re a community-powered nonprofit, our teams are made of
volunteers, and all the work we do is open source.

Features
--------

-  Tox configuration
-  Sane setup.py for easy PyPI registration/distribution
-  Choice of Open Source License options
-  Standard templates for README, issues and pull requests, Contribution
   guidelines

Requirements
------------

This repo uses the `Cookiecutter`_ templating project. You will need to
install Cookiecutter. The recommended method is by a pip install:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install cookiecutter

Usage
-----

To generate a new repo:

::

   $ cookiecutter gh:hackoregon/backend-cookiecutter-django --checkout BRANCH

You can leave out the ``--checkout BRANCH`` if checking out from MASTER.

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create
a backend-cookiecutter-django with your new package.

At this point, you are ready to connect with an external git.
