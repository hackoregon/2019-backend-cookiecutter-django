[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hackoregon/2019-backend-cookiecutter-django.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hackoregon/2019-backend-cookiecutter-django)

A cookiecutter template for creating reusable Django REST Framework
packages with the best practices quickly. This template is customized to
provide structure for quickstarting a Hack Oregon civic data project.

# What is Hack Oregon?

[Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) is a rapid prototyping lab taking a creative approach to
data projects that bring insight to complex issues in the public
interest. Weâ€™re a community-powered nonprofit, our teams are made of
volunteers, and all the work we do is open source.

# Features

  - Pytest testing
  - Sane setup.py for easy PyPI registration/distribution
  - MIT Open Source Licensed
  - Standard templates for README, issues and pull requests,
    Contribution guidelines

# Requirements

This repo uses the [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) templating project. You will need to
install Cookiecutter. The recommended method is by a pip install:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

# Usage

A more in-depth Training and User Guide is available [here](trainingdocs/TrainingGuide,pdf)

To generate a new repo:

    $ cookiecutter gh:hackoregon/2019-backend-cookiecutter-django --checkout BRANCH

You can leave out the `--checkout BRANCH` if checking out from MASTER.

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create
a backend-cookiecutter-django with your new package.

At this point, you are ready to connect with an external git and start coding.

## Cookiecutter values

You will be asked the following information when creating a project:

    {

      "github_username": "yourname",
      "hack_oregon_team": "Transportation Systems",
      "year": "2019",
      "github_repo": "2019-transportation-systems-backend",
      "python_package_namespace": "hackoregon_transportation_systems",
      "python_subpackage": "toad",
      "project_short_description": "Your project description goes in here",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "gis_project": "True"
    }

# Tests

To run tests on the Cookiecutter generation, please install TOX, which
is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool.

TOX is available to install from PyPI via pip:

```
   $ pip install tox
```

It will automatically create a fresh virtual environment to run tests.

Then just run:


```
tox
```
